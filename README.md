## A Refurbishment of the Outdated Computer Science Website

The University of Ghana Computer Science website is outdated and no longer accurately represented as department's offerings and achievements.
This project aims to create a modern, user-friendly website  that showcases the departments accomplishments and provides valuable information to potential students,
faculty and stuff

### Objectives
* Design a visually appealing and easy-to-navigate website that reflects the department's professionalism and excellence.
* Provide comprehensive information about the department, its programs, and its faculty and staff members.
* Highlight research opportunities, events, and resources available to students and faculty.
* Improve communication between the department and its stakeholders by providing a centralized platform for updates and announcements.
